            Basic energy
        </h4>
        <p>
            (Get the pun?) Basic energy is the stuff that powers up your Pokemon and lets it attack. There are 8 diffrent
            energy types. All of the energy types include Water, Metal, Dark, Psychic, Fire, Electric, and Fighting.
            Which energy you should put in your deck (more on decks later.) depends on your Pokemon's energy requirements
            (more on that later also.). In the top of the card, it shows the type of energy. In the middle,
            the picture of the energy, and on the bottom it shows the set that the card came out of
            and the card number.

        <h4>
            Special energy
        </h4>
        <p>
            Special energy is a certain type of energy with special qualities. Special energy can only
            be used on some of your Pokemon's energy requirements. Some Special energies like Luminous energy can be used on
            any of your Pokemon's requirements. The types of special energy include Luminous, Gift, Mist, Theraputic, Reversal,
            Jet, Boomerang, Treasure, ect.

            You don't want to always use Special energy, it just depends. In the top of the card, it 
            shows the type of Special energy. In the middle, the picture of the energy, and on the bottom
            it shows the set that the card came out of(i.e., SVE), the card validity(the little letter), 
            the card rarity(the little circle, diamond, or between 1 and 3 stars.), and the card number(i.e., 001).

        <h4>
            Supporters
        </h4>
        <p>
            Supporters are an essential part of a deck. You can only use one supporter per turn, and
            you can't use a supporter on you first turn. Some supporters give you and your 
            opponent a fresh hand, some let you get your eveolution Pokemon(more on that later,), and others 
            make your opponent switch their active Pokemon.

            You have to make sure your supporters align with the tactics of your deck. So if 
            your deck was about stalling like the Snorlax Stall deck, you could use a Boss's Orders
            to put up your opponent's Pokemon with the highest retreat(retreat stuff later.) cost.
            Or if you want to speed things up with your evolutions, you can use a suporter like Jacq
            to take two evolutuion Pokemon out of your deck.

            A supporter card has these traits: On the top, it says "Supporter" and the supporter's
            name(i.e., Arven), and in the middle it has a picture of the supporter and it says what it
            does. Like Arven's card says, "Search you deck for an Item card and a Pokemon tool card, reveal
            them, and put them in your hand. Then, shuffle your deck." On the bottom of the card,
            it show the card's validity, the release it came from, the card number, the rarity, and
            the card genre's rule. (I.e., "You may only play 1 Supporter card during your turn.")
