        <p>
            (Get the pun?) Basic energy is the stuff that powers up your Pokemon and lets it attack. There are 8 diffrent
            energy types. All of the energy types include Water, Metal, Dark, Psychic, Fire, Electric, and Fighting.
            Which energy you should put in your deck (more on decks later.) depends on your Pokemon's energy requirements
            (more on that later also).

        <h4>
            Special energy
        </h4>
        <p>
            Special energy is a certain type of energy with special qualities. Special energy can only
            be used on some of your Pokemon's energy requirements. Some Special energies like Luminous energy can be used on
            any of your Pokemon's requirements. The types of special energy include Luminous, Gift, Mist, Theraputic, Reversal,
            Jet, Boomerang, Treasure, ect.

            You don't want to always use Special energy, it just depends.

        <h4>
            Supporters
        </h4>
        <p>
            Supporters are an essential part of a deck. You can only use one supporter per turn, and
            you can't use a supporter on you first turn. Some supporters give you and your 
            opponent a fresh hand, some let you get your eveolution Pokemon(more on that later,), and others 
            make your opponent switch their active Pokemon.

            You have to make sure your supporters align with the tactics of your deck. So if 
            your deck was about stalling like the Snorlax Stall deck, you could use a Boss's Orders
            to put up your opponent's Pokemon with the highest retreat(retreat stuff later.) cost.
            Or if you want to speed things up with your evolutions, you can use a suporter like Jacq
            to take two evolutuion Pokemon out of your deck.

        <h4>
            Tools
        </h4>
        <p>
            Tools are pretty cool. You can only have one tool per Pokemon, and you can't remove them. Tools can be like Bravery Charms to 
            give your  Pokemon some extra health. There are plenty of tools you can use. Like handheld
            fan, it switches energy from your opponents active Pokemon to one of their benched when they damage you(Even if you get knocked out!)

        <h4>
            Items
        </h4>
        <p>
            Item cards are an ecential part of your deck. Items can be used to retreve cards from the deck,
            such as Pokemon, more items, supporters, tools, ect. The Buddy-Buddy Poffin can be used to
            get two seventy health points or less basic Pokemon.

        <h4>
            Stadiums
        </h4>
        <p>
            Stadiums are not always necessary when it comes to Pokemon. Some stadiums can be very useful in decks. One stadium lets you discard a psychic energy to heal thirty damage from all of your Pokemon. Another lets you put one basic Pokemon from you deck on your bench.

        <h4>
            Ace Specs
        </h4>
        <p>
            Ace specs are really cool because they are super strong cards that you can only have one of in your deck. One ace special
            allows you to poison, burn, and confuse your opponent's Pokemon! (more on that later) Another will swap
            both your Pokemon and your opponent's to the bench and you get to pick which one of your opponent's 
            Pokemon go to the active spot and you get to pick wich one of your Pokemon go to the active spot. (more on benches and active
            spots and other things later)

            You physically cannot play Pokemon without basic Pokemon. Basic Pokemon are the lifeline of your deck. Basic Pokemon is how you get your big attackers for your deck. Quaxly only has small attacks it can use, but when you get to it's final evolution, Quaqavual, he's powerful.
