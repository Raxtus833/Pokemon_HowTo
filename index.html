        </h4>
        <p>
            (Get the pun?) Basic energy is the stuff that powers up your Pokemon and lets it attack. There are 8 diffrent
            energy types. All of the energy types include Plant, Water, Metal, Dark, Psychic, Fire, Electric, and Fighting.
            Which energy you should put in your deck depends on your Pokemon's energy requirements
            (more on that later also).

            Special energy
        </h4>
        <p>
            Special energy is a certain type of energy with special qualities. Special energy can only
            be used on some of your Pokemon's energy requirements. Some Special energies like Luminous energy can be used on
            any of your Pokemon's requirements. The types of special energy include Luminous, Gift, Mist, Theraputic, Reversal,
            Jet, Boomerang, Treasure, ect.

            You don't want to always use Special energy, it just depends.

        <h4>
            Supporters
        </h4>
        <p>
            Supporters are an essential part of a deck. You can only use one supporter per turn, and
            you can't use a supporter on you first turn. Some supporters give you and your 
            opponent a fresh hand, some let you get your eveolution Pokemon(more on that later,), and others 
            make your opponent switch their active Pokemon.

            You have to make sure your supporters align with the tactics of your deck. So if 
            your deck was about stalling like the Snorlax Stall deck, you could use a Boss's Orders
            to put up your opponent's Pokemon with the highest retreat cost.
            Or if you want to speed things up with your evolutions, you can use a suporter like Jacq
            to take two evolutuion Pokemon out of your deck.

        <h4>
            Tools
        </h4>
        <p>
            Tools are pretty cool. You can only have one tool per Pokemon, and you can't remove them. Tools can be like Bravery Charms to 
            give your  Pokemon some extra health. There are plenty of tools you can use. Like handheld
            fan, it switches energy from your opponents active Pokemon to one of their benched when they damage you(Even if you get knocked out!)

            Item cards are an ecential part of your deck. Items can be used to retreve cards from the deck,
            such as Pokemon, more items, supporters, tools, ect.

        <p>
            Stadiums are not always necessary when it comes to Pokemon. Some stadiums can be very useful in decks. One stadium lets you discard a psychic energy to heal thirty damage from all of your Pokemon.

        <h4>
            Ace Specs
        </h4>
        <p>
            Ace specs are really cool because they are super strong cards that you can only have one of in your deck. One ace spec
            allows you to poison, burn, and confuse your opponent's Pokemon! Another will swap
            both your Pokemon and your opponent's to the bench and you get to pick which one of your opponent's 
            Pokemon go to the active spot and you get to pick wich one of your Pokemon go to the active spot. (more on benches and active
            spots and other things later)

            You and your opponent's pokemon have weaknesses. For example, a fire type pokemon's weakness would be water, because water puts out fire. Water's weakness is lightning because water coduncts lighting.  Make sure you think about real-world weaknesses in pokemon.

        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>To start the game off, you shuffle your sixty card deck and hand it to your opponent. Your opponent with either cut or tap it. If your opponent choses to shuffle your deck, you get the final cut. Then you draw seven cards and look at them. If you have a basic pokemon in your hand, put it down in the middle of your play space. IF you have any more basic pokemon, you can put them in your bench below you active pokemon. You can only have five pokemon on your bench at a time. Then, you draw six cards and you DO NOT look at them. You put them face down on the top left space of your play area. Then put your deck face down in the top right of your play area. After setup, roll a dice or flip a coin. If you called heads and it was heads or an even number, you go first. To start your turn, you draw one card. You can attach one energy to your pokemon once per turn, play as many item cards as you want to, attach one tool per pokemon, put down a stadium, use stadiums or abilities, or play supporters. If you are going first, you CANNOT play a supporter until your next turn. You can only play one supporter per turn. At the end of your turn, you can attack. Make sure you read your cards. If you want to attack, make sure you have the right amouint of energy on your pokemon. It will say on the left of the attack you want to use. When you attack, you take one prize card if it's a normal pokemon, but you take two if it's a pokemon EX. To win, you can one, take all of your prize cards, two, run your opponent out of deck, or three, kill your opponents active pokemon and he has no bench pokemon. If you get knocked out, you promote one of your benched pokemon to the active spot. If you want to evolve a pokemon, your pokemon has to have been in last turn. If it wasn't, you cannot evole it.
