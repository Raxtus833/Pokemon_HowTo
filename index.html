        Okay, lets start with the basics.

        <h3>
        Basic energy
        </h3>
        <p>
        (Get the pun?) Basic energy is the stuff that powers up your Pokémon and lets it attack. There are 8 diffrent
        energy types. All of the energy types include Water, Metal, Dark, Psychic, Fire, Electric, and Fighting.
        Which energy you should put in your deck (more on decks later.) depends on your pokemon's requirements
        (more on that later also.).
